Autonomous driving - part 2
    + Load the pickle file which contains dataset generated from previous assignment.
    + Create a Convolution neural network whose output is a softmax function.
    + Train a model to calculate the train, validation and test accuracies and errors.
    + The dataset should be spit in the ratio 60:20:20.
    + Do the same with augmented dataset - Horiontal flip and random rotation 
    + Do the same with grayscale images and compare the performance of the model with difference inputs

    - observation: The model does require the color to perform well, hence performance of the model is of the order 
      unaugmented data > augmented data > grayscale image
