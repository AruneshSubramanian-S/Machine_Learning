Filtering
    + Use OpenCV to load image, do color changes and add different noises (Salt and Pepper Noise, Gaussian Noise) to the image.
    + Create a CNN to perform 2d convolution using different kernels.
    + Use OpenCV to performance different filtering options (Average, Gaussian, Median, Bilateral) and compare the performance.
